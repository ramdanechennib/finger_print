The system includes a button that allows exporting attendance data to an Excel file. The information is organized based on check-in or check-out status, and the user can choose a specific time period (day, week, or month). This feature facilitates efficient analysis and tracking of employee attendance.

### 4.la base de donn√©e
*This project uses a MySQL database to manage employee attendance with two tables: **employees** and **attendance**. XAMPP is used to host the MySQL server locally. The Python app connects to the database using mysql.connector.*



CREATE TABLE **employees** (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    fingerprint_id INT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE **attendance** (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    employee_id INT,
    date DATE,
    time TIME,
    status ENUM('IN', 'OUT'),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(id)
);
